We stayed for two nights for a see meeting. It is an upscale chain hotel and was very clean. The services were very good, as the hotel front desk employees were kind and knowledgeable. The rooms were decent sized and have soft mattresses. The restaurant has good seafood, but was a bit expensive. We should come back to meet again here.
